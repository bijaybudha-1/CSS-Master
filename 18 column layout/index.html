        </h1>
        <p>A computer is an electronic device that can process and store information. It can perform calculations, manipulate data, and execute instructions to accomplish specific tasks. The basic components of a computer include the central processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM), storage (hard drive or solid-state drive), input devices (keyboard, mouse, etc.), output devices (monitor, printer, etc.), and various peripheral devices (such as USB drives or external hard drives). It is a programmable device and it executes tasks by running the instructions stored in its memory. These tasks are executed based on predefined algorithms that process an output.</p>
