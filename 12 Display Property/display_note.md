# Display Property
The `display` property controls how an element is rendered and interacts with other elements on the page.

#Common Display Values:
__1. block__:
* Element takes up the full width.
* Starts on a new line.
```
display: block;
```
__2. inline__:
* Element takes up only as much width as necessary.
Does not start on a new line.
```
display: inline;
```

__3. inline-block__:
* Behaves like `inline`, but you can set height and width.
```
display: inline-block;
```

__4. none__:
* Hides the element (it wonâ€™t take up any space).
```
display: none;
```
