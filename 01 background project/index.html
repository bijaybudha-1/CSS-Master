        <p>
          The CPU is often considered the brain of the computer, as it performs
          most of the processing and calculations required for a computer to
          function. RAM is the temporary memory that stores data and
          instructions while the computer is running, while storage is the
          long-term memory where data is stored even when the computer is turned
          off.
