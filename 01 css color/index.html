    <h1>What is web developement?</h1>
    <p>
      Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks
      associated with creating, building, and maintaining websites and web
      applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, also include
      web design, web programming, and database management.
    </p>
    <h2>What Exactly is Web Development?</h2>
    <p>
      Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features
      and functionality of websites and apps (often called “web design”), but
      the “web development” term is usually reserved for the actual construction
      and programming of websites and apps.
    </p>
    <h3>Types of Web Development?</h3>
    <p>
      There are three main types of web development: front-end development,
      back-end development, and full-stack development.
